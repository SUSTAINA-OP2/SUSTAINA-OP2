## What is SUSTAINA-OP&trade; Series?
SUSTAINA-OP&trade; series is an open hardware platform designed to reduce the high costs associated with developing robot hardware. 
It was adopted as the official robot of the "CIT Brains" team from Chiba Institute of Technology in Japan&#x1f38c;, leading them to win the world championship&#x1f3c6; in the RoboCup Humanoid League KidSize in 2022. 
Recently, many robots inspired by the SUSTAINA-OP&trade; series have emerged on the scene.

## Features of SUSTAINA-OP2&trade;
SUSTAINA-OP2&trade; has increased in size and gained more degrees of freedom compared to the  first SUSTAINA-OP&trade; developed in 2022. And, as an open hardware platform, it has experienced substantial growth.
- **Easier to make mechanical components and circuit boards** — Major mechanical components and circuit boards are optimized for outsourcing, simplifying the production process.
- **Reduced load mechanism for actuators** — Incorporating cross-roller bearings in limb joints and slider crank mechanisms in other joints to minimize actuator load.
- **Robust servo motors withstand intense motion** — Utilizing Kondo PMX series servo motors renowned for their robustness. Featuring I-cut output shafts to minimize shaft play compared to conventional serrated designs.
- **Powerful embedded AI computer for advanced robotics** — Powered by the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit, facilitating accelerated application development and prototyping.
